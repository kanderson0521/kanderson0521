Hi! Iâ€™m Kelly Anderson (she/her), a Data Analyst with 3+ yearsâ€™ experience and a background in various IT support roles. In my current role as a Customer Experience Analyst I define, develop, analyze, and leverage customer-based metrics to produce data-driven solutions to improve the customerâ€™s experience. I have a passion for discovering solutions hidden in data and enjoy collaborating with stakeholders and SMEs to improve business outcomes. 

Throughout my experience in the Applied Data Science Masterâ€™s program at Syracuse University, I gained a thorough understanding of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques and I am excited to leverage my analytical and programming skills toward product development, specifically in the NLP-space. I also have an interest in web development and am looking to movei nto a role where I can develop and help to deploy ML models and features. I love being a data analyst but not as much as programming.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning Docker and web development using the Flask framework to bring my models to life.
