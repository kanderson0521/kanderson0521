### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Iâ€™m Kelly Anderson (she/her), a Software Engineer in the NLP space with a background in data analysis and IT (took me awhile to find my passion but here I am). Graduated in December 2021 with a Master's in Data Science from Syracuse University, where I gained an interest in building NLP-based applications. I have been coding in Python for about 5 years and really enjoy the creative aspect of programming. 



âŒ¨ Iâ€™m currently working on a question and answer service augmented with a domain specific knowledgebase - stay tuned!

ðŸ”® Plan to learn JavaScript to create interactive web applications.
