With experience using data-oriented programming languages and visualization software, I bring data to life. Throughout my experience in the Applied Data Science Masterâ€™s program at Syracuse University, I have gained a thorough understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and I am excited to leverage my analytical and programming skills toward product development.

Throughout my studies, I developed a passion for text analytics and programming. I took additional courses outside my programâ€™s curriculum to learn model testing and deployment and looking to move into a ML/NLP Engineer. Check out some of my projects below.
