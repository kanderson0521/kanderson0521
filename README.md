Hi! Iâ€™m Kelly Anderson, a Data Analyst with 3+ yearsâ€™ experience and a background in various IT support roles. In my current role as a Customer Experience Analyst I define, develop, analyze, and leverage customer-based metrics to produce data-driven solutions to improve the customerâ€™s experience. I have a passion for discovering solutions hidden in large data sets and enjoy collaborating with stakeholders and SMEs to improve business outcomes. 

With experience using data-oriented programming languages and visualization software, I bring data to life. Throughout my experience in the Applied Data Science Masterâ€™s program at Syracuse University, I have gained a thorough understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and I am excited to leverage my analytical and programming skills toward product development.
