### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Iâ€™m Kelly Anderson, a Software Engineer in the NLP space with a background in data analysis and IT (took me awhile to find my passion but here I am). Graduated in December 2021 with a Master's in Data Science from Syracuse University, where I gained an interest in building NLP-based applications. I have been coding in Python for about 5 years and really enjoy the creative aspect of programming.



âŒ¨ Iâ€™m currently working on a React website, following along with the tutorial in The Road to React.

ðŸ”® Plan to create responsive web applications that utilize ML models.
